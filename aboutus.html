			<p>In April 1997, J. R. Murphy and John M. Grantland founded the firm along with the help of a paralegal and receptionist.  With the mission of providing high-quality legal services with uncompromising integrity and uncommon value, Murphy &amp; Grantland flourished and more than doubled its client base and workload.  In the next decade Murphy &amp; Grantland expanded to include over a dozen attorneys, paralegals, legal assistants, file clerks, as well as a human resource area, bookkeeping area, and information technology area.  After outgrowing three different office locations, Murphy &amp; Grantland built its permanent location at 4406-B Forest Drive in Columbia.</p>

			<p>With the diversity of legal experience we have attorneys that are able to specialize in specific areas of representation that include Insurance Coverage and Bad Faith, Premises Liability, Insurance Defense, Trucking Defense, Products Liability, Construction Defects, Employment Law, Medical and Professional Malpractice Defense and Workers' Compensation.</p>

			<p class="aboutHide">Over the course of these years Murphy &amp; Grantland, P.A. has been fortunate to hire support staff whose abilities and dedication have helped create the quality work product and results our clients have come to expect. A firm is only as good as its people and at Murphy &amp; Grantland, P.A. we pride ourselves on the quality of its employees. The firm now represents a number of clients including Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Zurich America Insurance Company, USAA Insurance, The Hartford, Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company, Progressive Insurance Companies, PMA Insurance Group, Piggly Wiggly Carolina Company, Inc. and many other insurance companies and self-insured businesses.</p>
